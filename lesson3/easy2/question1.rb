# In this hash of people and their age,
ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 402, "Eddie" => 10 }
# see if "Spot" is present.
ages.has_key?("spot")
ages.key?("spot")
ages[:spot]
ages.any?("spot")
ages.include?("spot")
ages.member?("spot")
#Bonus: What are two other hash methods that would work just as well for this solution?
